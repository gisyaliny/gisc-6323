    "\n",
    "N-grams are contiguous sequences of n items (words, characters, or tokens) extracted from a text corpus. In the context of natural language processing (NLP), N-grams are commonly used to capture patterns and dependencies between words in a sequence of text.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Advantages\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Capturing Context**: N-grams preserve some level of word order and context, allowing models to capture dependencies between adjacent words.\n",
    "- **Flexibility**: N-grams can be adjusted to different granularities (`unigrams`, `bigrams`, `trigrams`, etc.), providing flexibility in capturing different levels of context.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Drawbacks\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Sparsity:** As the length of the n-grams increases, the number of unique combinations grows exponentially, leading to sparsity issues, especially with smaller datasets.\n",
    "- **Lack of Generalization**: N-grams may **overfit** to specific patterns present in the training data, making them less generalizable to unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Mitigation Strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Pruning**: Limit the vocabulary size or discard low-frequency n-grams to reduce computational complexity.\n",
    "- **Smoothing**: Address data sparsity issues by smoothing probabilities of unseen n-grams.\n",

    "- `Word2Vec` uses a `softmax` function and `negative sampling` or `hierarchical softmax` to train the neural network efficiently.\n",
    "- `Word2Vec` consists of two primary architectures: `Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW)` and `Skip-gram`.\n",

    "- `FastText` extends `Word2Vec` by representing words as the sum of the embeddings of their `character n-grams`.\n",
    "  - A `character n-gram` is a set of co-occurring characters within a given window. It’s very similar to `word n-grams`, only that the window size is at the character level.\n",

    "## GloVe (Global Vectors for Word Representation)\n",
    "\n",
    "GloVe (Global Vectors for Word Representation) is a word embedding model introduced by Jeffrey Pennington, Richard Socher, and Christopher D. Manning in 2014. It is an **unsupervised learning** algorithm used for obtaining **vector representations** for words.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Design Purpose:\n",
    "\n",
    "- GloVe constructs a co-occurrence matrix where each entry represents the number of times a word co-occurs with another word in the global corpus.\n",
    "- It then learns word vectors by minimizing a weighted least squares regression objective function that captures the relationship between word vectors and their co-occurrence probabilities.\n"
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "### Advantage\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Global Co-occurrence Information**: GloVe leverages global `word co-occurrence statistics`, capturing richer semantic relationships between words beyond local contexts. It considers the `entire corpus` when learning word embeddings, which can lead to more informative embeddings.\n",
    "- **Robustness to Out-of-Vocabulary Words**: GloVe can handle out-of-vocabulary words better than Word2Vec and FastText by leveraging global statistics. It can capture semantic similarities between words even if they do not appear frequently in local contexts.\n",
    "- **Interpretability and Generalization**: GloVe embeddings often exhibit good interpretability and generalization capabilities due to their reliance on global co-occurrence statistics. They tend to capture broader semantic relationships and may generalize well to unseen data.\n"

  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "### Drawbacks\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Memory Intensive**: GloVe requires storing a large co-occurrence matrix in memory, which can be memory-intensive, especially for very large corpora.\n",
    "- **Training Complexity**: Although GloVe's objective function is relatively simple compared to neural network-based methods like Word2Vec, training GloVe still involves optimizing a large number of parameters.\n",
    "- **Fixed Context Window**: GloVe typically operates using a fixed context window for calculating co-occurrence statistics. While this window size can be adjusted, it still represents a limitation in capturing contextual information compared to methods that dynamically adjust the context window based on word frequency or document structure.\n"
